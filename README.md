Description: Repository for my master's thesis project. 

The goal of the thesis is to create highly realistic 3D avatars that can perform generated sign language animations in VR applications. The purpose of the avatars is to increase the availability of sign language material for deaf and hard hearing people, and as a supporting tool for deaf people and sign language interpreters at teaching deaf children sign language.
